- **Summary**: This paper explores the scalability of sparse autoencoders to extract interpretable features from large transformer models, like Claude 3 Sonnet. The study finds highly abstract features relevant to AI safety, including security vulnerabilities, bias, and deception. It demonstrates the potential of these features to influence model behavior and emphasizes the need for further research to understand their implications.
